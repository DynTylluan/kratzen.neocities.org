				<h2 id="s01"><a href="#s01">Introduction</a></h2>
					<p id="p01">After half a million words, <em>Kratzen</em> is proud to have an editor worth reading.</p>
					<p id="p02">I made <em>Kratzen</em> with one simple goal: to sort the wheat from the chaff. Within just twenty – four hours on a lazy Saturday, the Itch.io community released <em>over 150 new and in – progress games.</em></p>
					<p id="p03">With so many games being produced, how are you supposed to know what’s worth playing? Simple. Read <em>Kratzen.</em> Our articles are short enough for a quickie and long enough to digest. We’ll find you whatever you want to play.</p>
				<h2 id="s02"><a href="#s02">Developers deserve credit</a></h2>
					<p id="p04">In a 2016 <a href="http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/mobile-esports-and-vr-expand-and-increase-gaming-engagement.html">study from Nielsen</a>, <em>42%</em> of PC gamers learn about what to play from word – of mouth. Less than <em>half</em> that from online magazines. If <em>Kratzen</em> helps gamers find games that offer something new, it’s done a good thing.</p>
					<p id="p05">Every day, thousands of indie game developers, artists, musicians, and designers work their hearts out doing what they love, and nobody gives them any credit. It’s a big problem. <em>Kratzen</em> wants to fix that problem.</p>
					<p id="p06">When you look over a <em>Kratzen</em> article, with its distinctive voice and easy – to – read text, you can rest assured it’s the most honest, practical, and well – meaning article you’ll read today. Except for the next one, of course.</p>
				<h2 id="s03"><a href="#s03">Readers deserve rights</a></h2>
					<p id="p07">Most companies think you’ll steal their work. That’s why they place it under copyright. That means you can’t share it with your friends, save a copy for later, or do what you want with that magazine with your hard – earned money.</p>
					<p id="p08">In 2015, only <a href="https://stateof.creativecommons.org/2015/">3% of creators</a> were using CC0, getting rid of copyright. That’s 97% of stuff that you don’t really own. With <em>Kratzen,</em> we treat you as our friend, not an enemy. That’s why <a href="../../copying.html">we’re in the 3%</a> who use CC0.</p>
					<p id="p09">We believe, most of all, that everybody has the right to see the art that artists make. No contract, no strings attached. When you read <em>Kratzen,</em> you know that we’re the only major magazine that respects your rights as a reader.</p>
				<h2 id="s04"><a href="#s04">The big idea</a></h2>
					<p id="p10">I’ve written about a lot of games in my time. After a string of failed article submissions, six weeks on an indie game, two blogs, an art gallery, and an amateur art collective, I can safely say this magazine is my best project yet.</p>
					<p id="p11">I made <em>Kratzen</em> because it fills a need that other magazines don’t: it talks about the games that nobody else does. That’s why <em>Kratzen</em> is important — it gives a fair shake, and a fair review, to developers who need them most.</p>
					<p id="p12">We don’t ask for much. Just lend us your ears, and we’ll do alright.</p>
					<p id="p13">With love and respect — <b>Froge.</b></p>
