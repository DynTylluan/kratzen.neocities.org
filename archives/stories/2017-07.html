			<p>Guess who’s back? Well, you, for one, but also your boy Froge! Today we talk about Internet Welfare, a bunch of bad movies, the wonderous world of socialist economics, and some other garbage nobody cares about yet fills up the word count. <a href="../../articles/2017-07/five-months-with-kratzen.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Look! I’m not dead! I gave you full bloody warning about how I was writing a whole book, and in fact that’s the article under this one, so all I can do now is talk about anime and poor opinions about feminism.

I’m starting up a new non – fiction games design project, so read all about the not – so – juicy details, and also a lot of shilling. <a href="../../articles/2017-07/froge-is-writing-a-book.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Welcome, one and all, to the big questions that nobody asked for and would like to be blissfully ignorant of. Why not stop on by and talk about porn? We got some. Let me just scream that: FREE PORN! <a href="../../articles/2017-07/what-is-a-furry.html">☞</a></p>

Everything you could ever want is in this finale, and also some nonsense that nobody asked for and would like to forget. <a href="../../articles/2017-07/dunkeys-garbage-part-5.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Today’s installment in the increasingly inaccurately taglined Kratzen is a little indie game made from the creators of the first Momodora, and due to the laws of games development you would expect to be better than the first. <a href="../../reviews/2017-07/momodora-ii-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Froge finally answers the question as old as the site itself, so about three months old: “What do the stars mean?”. Like all good questions, everything and nothing, though one which makes it easy for me to get downvoted on Itch. <a href="../../articles/2017-07/what-doth-stars-mean.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Usually you can sum up an experience from the name. Not this time. It’s a lying name, whose only truth is that you fight. But it’s the implication of a good time that it lies about, and its implications are clear. <a href="../../reviews/2017-07/fight-knight-review.html">☞</a></p>

Essence Hunt is a serviceable story with serviceable writing used mainly for the copious amounts of fluffy foxy fanservice, bare chest and all.

			<p>How pleasant, it is, to finally see a game that is worth playing. I have searched long and far for this game, and though it’s short and not life-altering, it sure is an enjoyable one. But it would be ironic if the game <em>was</em> a virus. <a href="../../reviews/2017-07/dont-get-a-virus-review.html">☞</a></p>
