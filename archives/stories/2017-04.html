			<p>I have spent the last year writing over 600,000 words. I cannot say how I did it; I can say though that it took me a long journey to do such a thing. I have become a better person. This article chronicles the rise of the most famous Froge. <a href="../../articles/2017-06/the-froge-anniversary.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Kratzen happens to be an experiment, like all that I do. For though it is an experiment that provides great opportunity, I must look at the good it does me, and see if it’s worth keeping. Is it? It’s articles like these which find out. <a href="../../articles/2017-04/a-month-with-kratzen.html">☞</a></p>

As art evolves, we realise there is more to games than base desires such as dopamine-drugging fun. But is this art? <a href="../../reviews/2017-04/packing-up-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Looks like it’s time to earn some downvotes and publish another unpopular review. Meet Momodora, an unsung classic in the indie scene.

			<p>It sure is nice to live out my fantasy of kissing a cat. Yes, it’s one of those visual novels, where you don’t lay with your brood, but kiss them precisely once and the rest is fluff. It’s quite gay and also cute, but nothing more. <a href="../../reviews/2017-04/first-kiss-at-a-spooky-soiree-review.html">☞</a></p>
