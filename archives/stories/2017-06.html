			<p>The monthly Speech from the Throne is back again, as Froge takes you on a journey about what he’s been up to with the past month, and so better have a good excuse for not updating this magazine on time. <a href="../../articles/2017-06/two-months-with-kratzen.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Yes, this really happened. Teaming up with a legendary developer, Froge managed to make something touching, poignant, hilarious, and all – the – while sweet as well. Also, it’s about drunk frogs stuck on a leaf boat in the ocean. <a href="../../articles/2017-06/froge-made-a-visual-novel.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Dyson Sphere, in the flesh. This is a game that you’ve probably seen before, though is unique in that it’s one of the only monochrome games I’ve played… except for City Clickers, but we don’t talk about that. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/dyson-sphere-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>The Kong has landed. This is a game that all games should be: nonsense parodies of each other, though mostly of vapourwave. Yes, vapourwave, that old genre that has died a dozen times last decade. It’s also one of those “art games”. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/donkey-kong-exe-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>We have entered an era where anything is possible and yet nobody would like to make the first step. The question of why bad games continue to be released is answered, as well as why there are so few good games, and so few good devs. <a href="../../articles/2017-06/the-hell-that-is-developing.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>I am forced to attend to some engagements. However, I wish to correct these absenses by offloading some hard work onto someone else. So please enjoy “<a href="../../https_/www.youtube.com/watch68a2.html?v=T2rSIuEalJk">Top 5 Most Stunning Instances of Degeneracy in Goldeneye</a>”, which is a <em>masterpiece.</em></p>

			<p>The wonders of Discount Battlefield. This is what we call the “AAA” sector of indie gaming: too much ambition, so little professionalism. Get past the façade of bad graphics, and you see that it has bad <em>gameplay,</em> too. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/ravenfield-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Would anybody like to play SimCity? This isn’t that, but it’s something you might find on an old, theoretical games system, where everything is monochrome and monotonous and the gameplay is as barebones as can be. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/city-clickers-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Do you think the terrorists are mad for telling us how to defuse bombs deliberately made in the style of puzzle games? I don’t think they even have games. Fortunately us privileged sort can enjoy this good one, though short as their lives. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/bomb-squad-academy-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>I wonder how it feels to be an indie developer and spend years creating a video game only to have me take potshots at their bad work. This is one of those “typical” indie games you think when you read the word. Its reputation is undeserved. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/ftl-faster-than-light-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>I wanted to play another game as wildly wacky as this one, but you know. The idea of playing as a Cat with Gun’s is too much for me to handle, given the other game was Glover featuring an abundant lack of cats. <a href="../../reviews/2017-06/gun-cat-review.html">☞</a></p>

			<p>Another visual novel by another indie darling on another sardonic review by yours truly.
